== Code Convention ==

 - Why -

  . 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.

  . Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original
    author.

  . Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing
    engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.

  . If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it
    is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create. 




== Source organization ==

  . README me
  . lib/ contain a toolbox with high level modules



== File ==

  . Tabs must be avoided as indentation char, spaces should be used
    instead, because the semantics of tabs are not very well-defined
    in the computer world, and they can be displayed completely 
    differently on different types of systems and editors. 
    Also, tabs often get destroyed or wrongly converted during 
    copy&paste operations.

  . Indentation is 2 spaces

  . Avoid line longer than 80 chars

  
  . Files longer than 500 lines of code should be avoided
    You don't need all that functionality in a single file,
    split and modularize.
